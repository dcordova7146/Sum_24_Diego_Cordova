Dinosaur game Uniqueness
created multiple new functions related to meteor generation
added onto the unit class
-states enum 
	-idle (used by both rock and hero)
	-active(for checking if a rock is allowed to fall)
	-moving(for key hold movement)
-direction enum
	-left and right for the hold press movement
-act function
	using the isHero bool to set a unit to a hero (default is false)
	based on the ishero it checks the hold key press movement direction
	if not a hero a constant fall down is used for meteors

added onto main functions for meteors
-try spawn meteor 
	using a random chance of 2/1000 since this is run 1 every frame the 	activation rate seems fair
	if a rock is in the idle state it will then swap it to active and make it visible again, thus we are reusing the same rock to be more efficient
	(originally spawned a rock in a random spot across the top of the window 
	but checking all collision of many object made game run innefficiently)

-check collisions
	given a object by reference we check if it collides with the player or the floor
	both will reset the rock to the top of the screen but keep it hidden and in the idle state waiting a successful reactivation check
	if it collides with a hero however we can increment the amount of hits the player has taken
	
-takelife 
	called when a collision between player and meteor occurs increment hits taken and allow the visualization of strikes the player has 3 and its game over
